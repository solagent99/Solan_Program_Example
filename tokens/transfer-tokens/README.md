# Transfer Tokens

Just like with minting, transfers of SPL Tokens are conducted between Associated Token Accounts.   
   
You can use the `transfer()` function provided by the SPL Token Program to conduct a transfer of any SPL Token with the appropriate permissions.   
   
Check out [SPL Token Minter](../spl-token-minter) or [NFT Minter](../nft-minter) to learn more about Associated Token Accounts.
