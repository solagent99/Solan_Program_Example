# Recommended Program Layout

This is the typical layout for a Solana program as it grows in size and begins to require multiple Rust files. You'll notice a lot of the programs in the [Solana Program Library](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library) follow this format.

> Note: You can structure your Rust `src` folder however you wish - provided you follow Cargo's repository structure standards. You don't have to follow this pattern, but it's here so you can recognize other programs, too.
