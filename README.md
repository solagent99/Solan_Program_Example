# Program Examples

### :space_invader: Welcome, Solana Developer. :space_invader:   
   
Do you ever look at a bunch of examples of doing things on Solana and think to yourself: *"But how do I do this on-chain?"*   
   
   
We present to you this list of curated examples for a wide range of use cases implemented using **on-chain programs**.   
   
### :link: All on-chain. :crab: All Rust. :muscle: All the time. 

## Navigating this Repo

This collection is organized into the following sections:
- `program-basics` - The basics of writing Solana programs in Rust.
- `accounts`- Examples of creating & modifying accounts from on-chain.
- `tokens` - Examples of working with SPL Tokens from on-chain.
- `nfts` - Examples for various NFT use cases (including MetaPlex).
- `pdas` - Everything you need to know about working with Program Derived Addresses & program-owned accounts.
- `pda-programming-model` - Common Web2 design patterns implemented with PDAs on Solana.

Each example contains two folders:
- `native` - Written using Solana's native Rust crates and vanilla Rust.
- `anchor` - Written using Anchor's `anchor_lang` Rust crate and the associated Anchor framework to build & deploy.
