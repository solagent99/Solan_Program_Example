# Counter

This example program allows anyone to create a counter and increment it.

Any counter can be incremented by any key.

## Note: Seahorse

Seahorse currently does not allow the program to initialize anchor 
accounts unless they are PDAs. 

Seahorse example only allows users to increment the counter that corresponds to their public key.
